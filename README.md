# Anusha---Scroll-Art-Project

  In this project I created two different scroll art designs by using 2d arrays and for loops in order to loop through those 2d arrays. I designed both of my ascii art pieces, however I did use wikipedia for the unicode for some of the characters and Ms. Feng helped me to come up with the idea for the shooting stars design partially because my original idea was impossible.
  Overall, this project involved a lot of trial and error. First I drew a version of my bear on graph paper in order to figure out how I wanted it to look and then I started coding it. The code for the bear was much more straightforward, since I just manually inputed the ascii characters so that didn't take too much logic. The only thing which was a little tricky to figure out was how to make the bear at random locations in a loop, but I was able to figure that out relatively easily by randomly putting empty characters before I print the bear image. The shooting stars code was definitely a lot more difficult because it involved a lot more logic. I began by making methods for each type of character, the star and asterisk, and then trying to randomize it, but it didn't work and my original idea to "overide" certain parts of the terminal with empty characters was actually impossible. So then after, I worked with Ms. Feng in order to come up with a different version which had diagonal shooting star pattern. And then when I got home, I adjusted the code a little bit so that it repeated properly and the type of character could be randomized to be either an asterisk or a star.

  Citation Points:

  Shooting Stars - 1, because Ms. Feng helped my come up with the second version of the shooting star     design but she said that it was fine if I used it verbally and I also came up with it partially.

  Bear - 0, everything in it was original.
